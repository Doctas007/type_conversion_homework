# Task 10: Boolean Logic
# Instructions:
# 1. Convert each value to boolean using bool()
# 2. Print the original value, its type, and boolean result
# 3. Observe which values become True and which become False

# Values to test
value1 = 0  # integer zero
value2 = 1  # integer one
value3 = ""  # empty string
value4 = "hello"  # non-empty string
value5 = 0.0  # zero as float

# TODO: Convert each value to boolean
result1 = None  # Replace None with your code
result2 = None  # Replace None with your code
result3 = None  # Replace None with your code
result4 = None  # Replace None with your code
result5 = None  # Replace None with your code


# TODO: Print each value, its type, and its boolean conversion
