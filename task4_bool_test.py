# Task 4: bool() Test
# Instructions:
# 1. Convert each value to boolean using bool()
# 2. Print the original value, converted result, and its type
# 3. Observe which values become True and which become False

# Values to test
value1 = 0
value2 = 1

# TODO: Convert value1 to boolean

# TODO: Convert value2 to boolean
result2 = None  # Replace None with your code

# TODO: Print each original value, its boolean conversion, and type
