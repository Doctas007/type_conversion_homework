# Task 6: Concatenate vs Add
# Instructions:
# 1. Try string concatenation with "2" + "3"
# 2. Convert strings to integers and add them
# 3. Compare the results

# TODO: Concatenate strings "2" and "3"
str_result = None  # Replace None with your code

# TODO: Convert strings to integers and add them
int_result = None  # Replace None with your code

# TODO: Print both results (concatenation and addition) and their types
